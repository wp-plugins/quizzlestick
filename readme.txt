== Description ==

Use Quizzlestick to create quizzes to question your users and test their knowledge.

Create one of two types of quizzes to test your visitors:

* Single Answer - Choose your single answer from a multiple choice question.
* Which Are You / Is It? - A series of questions to find out about you.

The other options available include setting a description for the quiz, time limit, and correct and incorrect answer text.
You can choose how many points each answer is worth including negative values for making the quiz extra difficult.
Images can be added for each quiz, question and answer.

Quizzes are embedded into posts with a shortcode that is shown in the Embed meta box and it will look like `[quizzlestick id=1]`.
